# 1. Project Description
Daydiary is a program for storing user's diary - what has happened over the course of the day or other period of time.
Program comes with a graphical interface - calendar view of the stored diaries. Daydiary does not allow user to change the previously written diaries. Every date has an option to insert an image, leave a note and pin the content, so that it is easier to find it later on.
Just as life stories, diary inputs cannot be changed or deleted. What once was written will always be there. It is possbile to open the diary before midnight and write past midnight. In that case, user has a right to write there until closing the program.
The data the program stores is only on users personal computer and is not accessible to anyone else. Password protection is optional, but recommended.
Optionaly, the author of the diary will have an opportunity to export the diary as _pdf document_ to print it and have it physically.
Users intput analysis such as number of words, diversity of words and others are visible to user in the program subsection _statistics_.
