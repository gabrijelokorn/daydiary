# 1. Project Description
Daydiary is a program for storing user's diary - what has happened over the course of the day or other period of time.\
Program comes with a graphical interface - calendar view of the stored diaries. Daydiary does not allow user to change the previously written content. Every date has an option of inserting an image, leaving a note and pinning the content. Latter is used for faster access of specific content when searching and is in other applications often denoted as _favorites_.\
Just as life stories, diary inputs cannot be changed or deleted on the date of writting. What once was written will always be there. It is possbile to open the diary before midnight and write past midnight. In that case, user can write until closing the program.\
The data the program stores is only on user's personal computer and is not accessible to anyone else. Password protection is optional, but recommended.\
Optionaly, the author of the diary will have an opportunity to export the diary as _pdf document_ so which is printable.\
User's intput analysis such as number of words, diversity of words and others are visible to user in the program subsection _statistics_.\
