# Project Proposition

## 1. Project Summary

## 2. Project Idea
- ### Background
    Writing a diary is not a common activty and there are not many programs supporting it. People writing a diary digitaly often encounter a problem of programs not offering confidentiality. It is however among the most important concepts of writing a diary and should not be ignored.
    
    A few applications offering similar service are availible for free. Among them are best known [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/) (Unix), [RedNotebook](https://rednotebook.app/) (Linux) and [Diarium](https://diariumapp.com/) (Windows).

    The other solutions do not offer everything one might desire, such as expotring to pdf, pining the diary input etc. DayDiary will offer specifics that other apps might have missed.
- ### Area and Motivation
    We got asipiration when we searched the World Web for an appropiate *diary* program for Linux OS. We did not find any solution that could satisfiy our safty expectaions.

    Before writing to ordinary text files, diaries were written on paper. Doing it in a digital form speeds up the process of writing and comes with other features such as erasing, embellishing text, etc.

    Unlike most common applications, Daydiary will be platform (OS) independent and will provide safe diary encryption. Daydiary has a unique feature of professional data analysis and it's graphical presentation.

    End audience of this project is everyone intenting to write a confidential digital diary. Confidentiality and simplicity of this program will convince our audince to use our solution for their to get their job done.
- ### Purpose
    Solution serves as an accessory for an individual personal growth. Program does not have any use in scientific and reaserch space or business. This project's main goal is to make **confidential** digital diary for users of Linux operating system. Since there are no free solutions to assure confidential and user friendly use of digital diary, DayDiary will make this contribution to Linux operating systems. End users will be able to analyze their diary input and improve their expression of thoughs.
- ### Objective
    Solution will be presented as a standalone application. The program will **not** use any communication with internet. User's diary will only be accessible to an individual with their own computer and password. 
- ### Solution Guidelines
    The most prioritized guideline building this project will be to assuer high level of data security and assuring simple use and installation of program.
- ### End Users
    Everyone willing to write a digital diary will be a potential customer. Since there is no clinet-server involved, the number of customers does not affect our service. Expected number of customers is one, but the project will be built as there were millions of which most do not have knowledge of software engineering. Only end users will benefit from this promram, since there are no inderctly connected people to this project.
