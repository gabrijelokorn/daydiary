## 1. Project Summary

## 2. Project Idea
- ### Background
    Writing a diary is not a common activty and there are not many programs supporting this it. People writing a diary digitaly often encounter a problem of programs not offering confidentiality. It is however among the most important concepts of writing a diary and should not be ignored.
    
    A few applications offering similar service are availible for free. Among them are best known [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/) and [Diarium](https://diariumapp.com/).

    The other solutions do not offer everything one might desire, such as expotring to pdf, pining the diary input etc. DayDiary will offer specifics that other apps might have missed.
- ### Area and Motivation
    Asipiration for this project came to me when I searched the World Web for a appropiate program for Linux OS. I did not find any solution that could satisfiy my safty expectaions.

    Before writing to ordinary text files, diaries were written on paper. Doing it in a digital form speeds up the process of writing and comes with other features such as erasing, embellishing, etc.

    Unlike other common applications, Daydiary is for Linux operating systems and provides safe diary encryption.

    Daydiary has a unique feature of professional data analysis and it's graphical presentation.

    End audience of this project is everyone intenting to write a confidential digital diary.

    Confidentiality and simplicity of this program will convince our audince to use our solution for their to get their job done.
